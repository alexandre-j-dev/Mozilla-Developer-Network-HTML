<!-- Task 1:
In this task, we want you to embed a simple audio file onto the page. You need to:
Add the path to the audio file to an appropriate attribute to embed it on the page. The audio is called audio.mp3, and it is in a folder inside the current folder called media.
Add an attribute to make browsers display some default controls.
Add some appropriate fallback text for browsers that don't support <audio>. -->

<h1>Basic audio embed</h1>
&lt;empty audio&gt; <br>

<!-- Answer 1 -->
<span class="title"> Done </span><br>

<audio controls>
  <source src="media/audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3" >
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support this audio file. Here is a
    <a href="media/audio.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.
  </p> 
</audio>

<!-- Task 2:
In this task, we want you to mark up a slightly more complex video player, with multiple sources, subtitles, and other features besides. You need to:
Add an attribute to make browsers display some default controls.
Add some appropriate fallback text for browsers that don't support <video>.
Add multiple sources, containing the paths to the video files. The files are called video.mp4 and video.webm, and are in a folder inside the current folder called media.
Let the browser know in advance what video formats the sources point to, so it can make an informed choice of which one to download ahead of time.    
Give the <video> a width and height equal to its intrinsic size (320 by 240 pixels).
Make the video muted by default.
Display the text tracks contained in the media folder, in a file called subtitles_en.vtt, when the video is playing. You must explicitly set the type as subtitles, and the subtitle language to English.
Make sure the readers can identify the subtitle language when they use the default controls.

<!-- Task 3
In this task, we want you to:
Embed a PDF into the page. The PDF is called mypdf.pdf, and is contained in the media folder.
Go to a sharing site like YouTube or Google Maps, and embed a video or other media item into the page. -->

<h1>Embedding</h1>

<!-- Answer 3 -->

<p> <q>If you need to display PDFs, it's usually better to link to them, rather than embedding them in the
