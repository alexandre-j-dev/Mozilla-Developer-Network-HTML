    <!-- Task 2:
    In this task, we want you to add some semantics to the provided HTML as follows
    Turn the second paragraph into a block-level quote, and semantically indicate that the quote is taken from Accessibility.
    Semantically mark up "HTML" and "CSS" as acronyms, providing expansions as tooltips.
    Use subscript and superscript to provide correct semantics for the chemical formulae and dates, and make them display correctly.
    Semantically associate machine-readable dates with the dates in the text. -->

    <h1>Advanced text semantics</h1><br>

    <p>Let's start with a quote:</p>
    <p>By default, HTML is accessible, if used correctly.</p>
    <p>CSS can also be used to make web pages more, or less, accessible.</p>
    <p>Chemical Formulae: H2O (Water), C2H6O (Ethanol).</p>
    <p>Dates: December 25th 2019 (Christmas Day), November 2nd 2019 (Día de los Muertos).</p>

    <!-- Answer 2 -->
    <span class="title"> Done </span>

    <p>Let's start with a quote:</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility">
        <p>By default, <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is accessible, if used correctly.</p>
